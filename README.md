# vue-lunch-and-learn

This is a simple repository to help with learning the fundamentals of Vue.js which was used in the Intro to Vue.js L&L run in Dekker in May 2021.

While the react-counter contains a working counter application, the vue-counter needs to be completed by recreating what has been done in React with Vue features. By completing this exercise you will gain some experience in using the following within Vue.js:

- Single file components
- Props
- Data
- Methods and computed properties
- Styling
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering
- 2 way binding

The solutions to the exercise can be found in `vue-counter/solutions`

## react-counter
The react-counter folder contains some simple code for a small counter application built using React with some trivial CSS. The app was created using create-react-app.

To run the application, install the dependencies and then run the app as below:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## vue-counter
The vue-counter folder contains a sample project that was created using the vue-cli tool with the default presets for Vue 3.

To run the application, install the dependencies and then run the app as below:

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

Good luck!
